# OpenPassport

OpenPassport is a specification for a specialized, decentralized, universal digital passport with privacy and security in mind.

## Cover

- [`Custom cover image`]

## Information

- [`Nationality`]
- [`Gender`]
- [`Age`]
- [`Date of Birth`]
- [`MORE ATTRIBUTES NEEDED`

## Citizenship info

- [`A guide to being a good citizen`]
- [`Support for dual-citizenship`]

## Encryption

This passport needs to have enough encryption to be able to withstand an attack from a post-NISQ quantum computer (a quantum computer with over 10000 qubits) For now, there are no known encryption methods strong enough to support this goal.

## Languages

The current specification is planned to be written in AWK, C, CSS, C++, M4, and Python. M4 is used for configuration, AWK is used for scripting, C is used for the backend, C++ is used for processing, CSS is used as a style language, and Python is used as the application language.
